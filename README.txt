# Tumbler Backup
Version 0.1.0 BETA

This is a beta release. Please report any bugs to realityfabric@gmail.com.

To use:

On Windows:
1. Run TumblerBackup
2. Read the disclaimer. Make a decision.
3. Enter a blog url (with or without .tumblr.com) into the text field.
4. Click the "Add Blog" button. The blog will be added to a list (viewable by clicking on the drop down menu), and the blog details will be displayed in the middle of the window.
5. Continue adding blogs to the list. Reorder them how you want*, blogs will be backed up in order from top to bottom.
6. There is a checkbox that says "Download Inline Media?" If you would like to back up media files that are embedded in the body of the post (e.g. images added to text posts) then check this box. It will take longer because the program will have to search posts for media links.
7. When you are ready to backup the blogs in your list, click the "Backup Blog(s)" button. WARNING: Once you have clicked this button you will not be able to stop it unless you force close it with Task Manager (on Windows, or a similar application on other operating systems).

The blog currently being backed up will be displayed in the Title bar of the window, as well as the number of posts left to be backed up (note that it only changes every 20 posts).

*Note that there is a bug with the decrease priority button. You can increase the priority of blogs instead if you encounter this.
